## Pet Shelter Adoption System 
### Project Scope:
The project will consist of creating a website and an Andorid mobile application for a local pet shelter. The goal is to design a software system that will help facilitate pet adoption processes. Through the website and the app, users will be able to post advertisements about pets to put up for adoption as well as look for pets they wish to adopt. Additionally, an admin of the pet shelter will be able to post advertisements about pets available for adoption on their premises. Pet adopters and owners will be able to communicate with each other through emails which will be visible on the users profile. Although there is no payment associated with the adoption process and thus no payment feature will be implemented, users will, however, be able to donate to the pet shelter if they wish. The donation process will be managed by a third party application.
